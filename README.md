# Apollo GraphQL demo

Demo setup with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) &amp; [Apollo Client](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo)

## Setup

- Run `make setup`

Have a look at the _Makefile_ for other helpful commands, or simply run `make help` on the console.
